CSES Problem Set Solutions
This repository contains my personal solutions to the problems found on the CSES Problem Set, a fantastic collection of competitive programming problems.

üìñ Introduction
The CSES Problem Set is a popular platform for practicing and honing algorithmic problem-solving skills. This repository serves as a log of my journey through these problems. My goal is to solve as many problems as possible and to document my solutions here.

The solutions are written primarily in C++. Each file is named after the corresponding problem on the CSES website.

üöÄ How to Use
Navigate to the folder corresponding to the problem category you're interested in.

Inside that folder, you will find files named after the specific problems (e.g., WeirdAlgorithm.cpp, DistinctNumbers.cpp).

The code is commented to explain the logic and approach used.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
These solutions are my own and are intended for educational and reference purposes. They represent one possible way to solve a problem and may not always be the most optimal or elegant solution.

I strongly encourage you to attempt the problems on your own first before looking at any solutions. The real learning comes from the struggle and the process of discovery!

ü§ù Contributing
While these are my personal solutions, I'm open to suggestions and improvements! If you have a more efficient algorithm, a cleaner implementation, or find a bug in my code, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
